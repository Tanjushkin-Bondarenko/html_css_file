                <img class="foto"  src="2022_audi.jpg" title="audi"/>
                <div class="article">The 2022 Audi R8 finishes near the top of our luxury sports car rankings. It has the breathtaking performance you expect from cars in this class, as well as a premium interior and easy-to-use technology.  Is the Audi R8 a Good Car? Yes, the Audi R8 is a good car. All models come with a throaty V10 engine that provides hair-raising acceleration and gobs of power. The R8 has impressive handling and a smooth ride. The stylish interior provides ample head- and legroom, and the tech features are user-friendly. The main drawbacks of the R8 are its microscopic trunk, poor gas mileage, and high price tag. 
                  Should I Buy the Audi R8?
You should consider the R8 if you’re looking for an eye-catching supercar and don’t care about practicality or price. Few luxury sports cars cost as much as this Audi, and its limited cargo space means you can’t drive it to the mall for a shopping spree. But if those things aren’t dealbreakers for you, then you can’t do much better than the R8.
